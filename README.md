# Attendance-Robot
## A robot using arduino and a camera to mark students present as they enter the classroom

### Steps Taken:
* Extract Raspberry Pi
* Experiment with Raspberry Pi functionality and determine unfit for purpose
* Find and collect most efficient Arduino and certain components
* Successfully connect to wifi
* Succesfully host a web server on connected wifi network
* Somewhat succesfully connect client to web server over wifi

### Currently Working On:
* Research best camera to use with Arduino for this project
* Improve web server stability and connection
* Work on attendance program
* Learn how to use pins of Arduino

### To Do List:
* Find and purchase best camera
* Write program that finds faces in video stream and compares to attendance list
* Host web server on arduino to run program remotely and be able to access on other devices in wifi network.
* Create shell to contain components and implement complete robot.
